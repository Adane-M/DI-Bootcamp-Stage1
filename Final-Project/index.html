            Early life
            Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in the East Harlem section of Manhattan in New York City.[14] While born Lesane Parish Crooks,            <br/>
            [15][16][17] at age one he was renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur.[18] He was named after Túpac Amaru II, the descendant of the last Incan ruler,             <br/>
            Túpac Amaru, who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his failed revolt against Spanish rule.[19] Shakur's mother explained, "I wanted him to             <br/>
            have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a world culture            <br/>
            and not just from a neighborhood."[18]

                Shakur had an older stepbrother, Mopreme "Komani" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa Shakur, two years his junior.[20]

                    Shakur's parents, Afeni Shakur—born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina—and his biological father, Billy Garland, had been active             <br/>
                    Black Panther Party members in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[21] A month before Shakur's birth, his mother was tried in New York City             <br/>
                    as part of the Panther 21 criminal trial. She was acquitted of over 150 charges.[22][23]

            Other family members who were involved in the Black Panthers' Black Liberation Army were convicted of serious crimes and imprisoned,             <br/>
            including Shakur's stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, who spent four years among the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Mutulu Shakur was apprehended in 1986 and subsequently convicted for a 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck, during which police officers and a guard were killed.[24]
            
            Shakur's godfather, Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a high-ranking Black Panther, was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery.            <br/>
            After spending 27 years in prison, his conviction was overturned due to the prosecution's having concealed evidence that proved his innocence.[25][26]
            
            Shakur's godmother, Assata Shakur, is a former member of the Black Liberation Army, who was convicted of the first-degree murder of a            <br/>
            New Jersey State Trooper and is still wanted by the FBI.[27]
