            Early life
            Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in the East Harlem section of Manhattan in New York City.[14] While born
            Lesane Parish Crooks, <br />
            [15][16][17] at age one he was renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur.[18] He was named after Túpac Amaru II, the
            descendant of the last Incan ruler, <br />
            Túpac Amaru, who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his failed revolt against Spanish rule.[19] Shakur's
            mother explained, "I wanted him to <br />
            have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a world
            culture <br />
            and not just from a neighborhood."[18]
            <br />
            Shakur had an older stepbrother, Mopreme "Komani" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa Shakur, two years his
            junior.[20]
            <br />

            Panther heritage
            Shakur's parents, Afeni Shakur—born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina—and his biological father, Billy
            Garland, had been active <br />
            Black Panther Party members in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[21] A month before Shakur's
            birth, his mother was tried in New York City <br />
            as part of the Panther 21 criminal trial. She was acquitted of over 150 charges.[22][23]

            Other family members who were involved in the Black Panthers' Black Liberation Army were convicted of
            serious crimes and imprisoned, <br />
            including Shakur's stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, who spent four years among the FBI's Ten Most Wanted
            Fugitives. <br />Mutulu Shakur was apprehended in 1986 and subsequently convicted for a 1981 robbery of a
            Brinks
            armored truck,<br /> during which police officers and a guard were killed.[24]

            Shakur's godfather, Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a high-ranking Black Panther, <br />was convicted of murdering a
            school teacher during a 1968 robbery. <br />
            After spending 27 years in prison, his conviction was overturned due to the prosecution's having concealed
            evidence that proved his innocence.[25][26]

            Shakur's godmother, Assata Shakur, is a former member of the Black Liberation Army, <br />who was convicted
            of the
            first-degree murder of a <br />
            New Jersey State Trooper and is still wanted by the FBI.[27]
